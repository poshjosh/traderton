# Trading Glossary

An alphabetic reference of trading-domain terms used across Traderton.

For generic agent-platform terms (Agent, Connection, Credential, …), see the
host platform's glossary.

## Agent Mode Purity

Your agent's goal text and your explicit constraints determine how your agent trades. The platform won't add hidden restrictions you didn't ask for. System-level rules (execution mode, slippage, retries) are always enforced.

## Approval

A trade proposal that is waiting for your review before execution. When your agent's Trade Authorization is set to **Approval required**, each trade decision becomes an approval you must explicitly approve or reject. Approvals expire after a configurable time window.

## Approval Code

A 6-character short code (e.g. `26B8D`) that identifies a specific pending approval. Use it with Telegram slash commands (`/yes 26B8D`, `/no 26B8D`) or the web Approvals panel.

## Authorization Mode

Controls whether your agent's trade decisions execute immediately or wait for your approval. Two modes: **Direct** (immediate execution) and **Approval required** (each trade waits for user approval). Set when creating or editing a trading-capable agent.

## Blueprint

The configuration that defines a bot — which strategy, which exchange account, which asset, risk limits, and execution mode. Blueprints are versioned and stable.

## Bot

An automated trading strategy. Bots follow a blueprint to trade on your behalf. Unlike agents, bots generally do not use AI — they follow predefined, rule-based strategies.

## Bot Run

One start-to-stop execution cycle of a bot. Records when it ran, which blueprint version it used, and how it ended.

## BPS (Basis Point)

One-hundredth of a percent (0.01%). 100 BPS = 1%. Used for slippage, fees, and thresholds throughout the platform.

## dailyLossLimit

A hard cap on how much your agent can lose in a rolling 24-hour window. Set in USD (or your account's base currency). If you don't set one, the platform applies a default limit based on a percentage of your capital.

## Decision

A proposal to change your exposure on an asset. Decisions are sent from agents or bots to the platform, which validates and executes them. The platform has the final say — a decision is a request, not a guarantee.

## Execution Mode

How your trades reach the market:

- **Test** — Simulated trading. Tracks real market data but does not place real orders. No real money at risk.
- **Live** — Real orders on real exchanges. Real capital at risk.

## globalMaxDrawdownPct

A platform-wide drawdown limit as a percentage. Applies to trading done outside of agents.

## maxDrawdown

Absolute dollar ceiling on how far your equity can fall from its peak. For agents, the percentage-based `maxDrawdownPct` is used instead.

## maxDrawdownPct

A hard cap on peak-to-current equity drawdown as a percentage. If your equity falls this far below its peak, trading stops. You set this on your agent; if you don't, the platform applies a default.

## maxOpenPositions

The maximum number of positions your agent can hold at once. Agents can lower this at runtime but can't exceed the platform's absolute maximum.

## Platform Safety Alert

A critical notification from the platform itself — not from your agent. Delivered for events like crashes, forced stops, or position mismatches with the exchange. Always on; you can't opt out.

## Reconciliation

The process of comparing what the platform thinks your positions are against what the exchange says they are. If there's a mismatch beyond acceptable limits, trading may be blocked until it's resolved.

## Skill Preset

A bundled set of trading capabilities for an agent. Determines which trading tools your agent can use. Examples: `trading`, `direct-trading`, `trading-assistant`.

## Slippage

The difference between the price you expected and the price you got. The platform simulates realistic slippage in test mode.

## stopLossCooldownMs

How long your agent must wait after a stop-loss exit before it can re-enter a position. Default: 5 minutes.

## Strategic Intent

What your agent wants to achieve — the desired final exposure, not a specific order. The platform figures out how to get there.

## Strategy Preset

A bundled configuration for a bot blueprint — default strategy parameters, risk limits, and execution settings. Examples: `momentum`, `dca`, `range`.

## targetSize

The desired final position size for an asset. This is the end goal, not the size of the next order. The platform plans the steps to reach it.

## Tick

One iteration of your agent's thinking cycle. On each tick, the agent reads context, may use tools, and may submit decisions. Tick speed depends on your agent's style.

## Trading Instance

The system that powers a bot behind the scenes. Handles planning, risk checks, execution, and state tracking. Users interact with bots; the platform runs trading instances.

## Venue Account

Your connection to a specific exchange (e.g. a Hyperliquid API key, a Solana wallet). Each bot blueprint references one venue account.
