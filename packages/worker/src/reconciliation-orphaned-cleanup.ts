// Shared reconciliation helper for shadow/paper mode orphaned position cleanup.
//
// When an agent or bot runs in shadow/paper mode, its local positions are
// simulated and never reflected on the real venue. On startup, reconciliation
// detects "local has position, venue has no position" as drift. This helper
// auto-closes those orphaned positions so the actor can start cleanly.
//
// Non-orphaned diffs (balance mismatches, venue-only positions, unknown fills,
// orphaned orders) are returned to the caller — they remain actionable and
// should still block trading in live mode.
